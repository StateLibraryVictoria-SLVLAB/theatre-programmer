## Theatre Programmer

Uses Tesseract to perform OCR on any image supplied as an input. The text identified in the image is then through a Flair Named Entity Recognition (NER) model, the output of which is returned to the page.

This is a prototype produced for a project at the State Library Victoria in Melbourne, Australia.

## Repository management

Hugging Face is used to host two version of the demo app:

2. a development version which is linked to the most recent branch pushed to GitHub that is **not** `main`

Deployment to Hugging Face is done via GitHub actions.
